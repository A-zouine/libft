# libft

> The libft is the first project of the “common core” of school 1337. There are different concepts already seen during the entrance contest (also called “the pool”).

> Get ready for some coding fun with Libft! It’s the first project you’ll tackle at 1337, and it’s all about creating a supercharged library of awesome functions in good ol’ C. We’re talking about functions that give the standard ones a run for their money!

> To make things even more exciting, you’ll be using a Makefile to compile and run your library. Say goodbye to those ordinary standard functions because you won’t be needing them here. Libft is your new go-to resource for all your future 1337 adventures.
